# Deploy a Python (Flask) app to Azure to Azure Containers Apps

This Python web app is a simple restaurant review application built with the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) framework. The web app stores application data in PostgreSQL with environment variables defining the connection info.

This repo was created to be built to a Docker image and run as a container instance in [Azure Container Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-apps/). For more information, see the tutorial [Deploy a Python web app on Azure Container Apps with GitHub Actions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/python/tutorial-deploy-python-web-app-azure-container-apps-01).

This Python web app repo can also be used in other ways:

* You can run the web app locally in a virtual environment. Make sure to define *.env* file with environment settings.

    * In the `.env` file, fill in a secret value for `SECRET_KEY`. You can use this command to generate an appropriate value for your product deployment:

    ```shell
    python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex())'
    ```


* You can create a container locally and run it in Docker locally. You'll need Docker Desktop installed. For this scenario, set REMOTE_POSTGRESQL=1 in *.env* file to point to a PostgreSQL instance. See the *.env.example* file for details.

  ```bash
  docker build --file Dockerfile --tag pythoncontainer:latest .
  docker run -it --env-file .env --publish 5000:5000/tcp pythoncontainer:latest
  ```

  If you want to use PostgreSQL instance locally, add `--add-host` to the Docker command. For more information, see the [Docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) command. For an example of how to do this with MongoDB, see [Build and test a containerized Python web app locally](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/python/tutorial-containerize-deploy-python-web-app-azure-02).

* You can deploy the code (not a container) to App Service. For guidance on how to deploy code, see [Quickstart: Deploy a Python (Django or Flask) web app to Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/quickstart-python) and [Overview: Deploy a Python web app to Azure with managed identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/python/tutorial-python-managed-identity-01).

* You can create a Docker image from this repo and host the container instance in Web Apps for Containers (App Service). See [Overview: Containerized Python web app on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/python/tutorial-containerize-deploy-python-web-app-azure-01).

If you need an Azure account, you can [create on for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

## Requirements

The [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) has the following packages:

| Package | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) | Web application framework. |
| [SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/SQLAlchemy/) | Provides a database abstraction layer to communicate with PostgreSQL. |
| [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy/) | Adds SQLAlchemy support to Flask application by simplifying using SQLAlchemy. Requires SQLAlchemy. |
| [Flask-Migrate](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Migrate/) | SQLAlchemy database migrations for Flask applications using Alembic. Allows functionality parity with Django version of this sample app.|
| [pyscopg2-binary](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/) | PostgreSQL database adapter for Python. |
| [gunicorn](https://pypi.org/project/gunicorn/) | WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX. Required for running containers locally in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/quickstart-python#_gunicorn-modifications-for-djangoflask-apps).  |
| [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) | Read key-value pairs from .env file and set them as environment variables. In this sample app, environment variables describe how to connect to the database and storage resources. Because managed identity is used no sensitive information is included in environment variables. <br><br> Flask's [dotenv support](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/cli/#environment-variables-from-dotenv) sets environment variables automatically from an `.env` file. |
| [flask_wtf](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-WTF/) | Form rendering, validation, and CSRF protection for Flask with WTForms. Uses CSRFProtect extension. |

The steps to do this are covered more completely in the tutorial [Deploy a Python web app on Azure Container Apps with GitHub Actions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/python/tutorial-deploy-python-web-app-azure-container-apps-01). Briefly, here are the steps:

1. Fork and then clone locally.
1. Build a container image from the repo.
1. Create a PostgreSQL Flexible Server instance.
1. Create a database on the server.
1. Deploy the web app container to Azure Container Apps.
1. Configure continuous deployment.

See the [create_resources.sh](./create_resources.sh) Bash script for automating the creation of these steps.
